    Chapter 2 walks through the historical contributions of Kepler's Laws, Galileo's 
    scientific confirmation of heliocentrism, and Newton's contributions to physics which
    successfully connected Galileo (and others') astronomical observations with _gravity_.
    {{< meta primary-authors >}} introduce work and energy, and derive Kepler's Laws before

## Kepler's Laws

The following laws --- Kepler's Laws --- are quoted directly from {{< meta primary-authors >}} @bob.
Each are derived later in Chapter 2. 

1. A planet orbits the Sun in an ellipse, with the Sun at one focus^[As {{< meta primary-authors >}} 
explain later in Chapter 2, objects in our solar system _actually_ orbit the solar system 
barycenter, which is located just outside the surface of the sun.] of the ellipse. 
2. A line connecting a planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervols. 
3. The Harmonic Law: $P^2 = a^3$.

Kepler's definitions place the paths of all orbits on _conic sections_: cross-sections
of a cone. While circular, elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic paths are all conic sections,
ach of the planets Kepler identified in the solar system have elliptical orbits. For this
reason, a substantial section of Chapter 2 reviews the geometry of ellipses. 

An ellipse has two focal points, with semimajor axis $a$ defined as one-half the length of
the diameter --- the line which passes through both focal points --- of the ellipse. The 
central body --- in our case, the Sun --- is located at one of the two focal points; that 
point is _principle focus_ @bob. The distance from the principle focus to an orbiting object
is referred to in @eq-equation-of-ellipse as $r$, and the distance from the other focus
is referred to as $r'$.
The semiminor axis $b$ is perpendicular to, and bisects, the semimajor axis. The eccentricity 
$e$ is the distance between both focal points divided by the major axis $2a$ @bob. The label
_perihelion_ on the ellipse, and on the major axis, which is closes to the principle focus;
the opposite point along the major axis is referred to as _aphelion_. The suffix _helion_
refers to our Sun. More general terms are _periapsis_ and _apoapsis_.

The following equations hold for ellipses. All are pulled from Chapter 2 of the text @bob. 

$$
r + r' = 2a
$$ {#eq-equation-of-ellipse}

$$
b^2 = a^2 (1 - e^2) 
$$ {#eq-eccentricity-axes}

Polar coordinates are convenient when describing conic orbits. The angle $\theta$
is the _true anamoly_, and represents the orbiting object's angular position past perihelion.
The distance from the principle focus $r$ is related to true anamoly; the precise relationship
relies on the _type_ of conic orbit. For elliptical orbits, @eq-ecc-true-anamoly relates $r$
and $\theta$; note that circular orbits are simply a special case where eccentricity $e$
is zero. @eq-par-true-anamoly relates $r$ and $\theta$ for parabolic orbits, with $p$
defined as the distance from the _single_ parabolic focus to perihelion. Finally,
for hyperbolic orbits, equation @eq-hyp-true-anamoly relates $r$ and $\theta$. An object 
on a parabolic orbit will be at rest when _infinitely far_ from the central gravitational 
body. A hyperbolic orbit would keep the object's speed positive while it travels away from
the central gravitational body. An object with a velocity _equal to_ to the central 
body's escape velocity $v_{\text{esc}}$ would follow a parabolic orbit. An object follows
a hyperbolic orbit if its velocity _exceeds_ the central body's excape velocity.

$$
\begin{array}{cc}
r = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1 + e\cos\theta} & (0 \leq e < 1)
\end{array}
$$ {#eq-ecc-true-anamoly}

$$
\begin{array}{cc}
r = \frac{2p}{1 + \cos\theta} & (e = 1)
\end{array}
$$ {#eq-par-true-anamoly}

$$
\begin{array}{cc}
r = \frac{a(e^2-1)}{1 + e\cos\theta} & (e > 1)
\end{array}
$$ {#eq-hyp-true-anamoly}

$$
v_{\text{esc}} = \sqrt{2 G M / r}
$$ {#eq-vesc}

## Newton's Laws

Each of Newton's Laws below are directly quoted from {{< meta primary-authors >}} @bob.

1. _The Law of Inertia_. An object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion 
will remain in motion in a straight line at a constant speed unless acted upon by an external force. 
2. The _net_ force (the sum of all forces) acting on an object is proportional to the object's
mass and its resultant acceleration.
3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction^[This law is clear when considering forces as _vectors_. "Mathematically, the third law can be represented as... $F_{12} = -F_{21}$" @bob.]

These laws, which are taught in high school physics classes, revolutionized physics. 
Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, shown in @eq-newton-gravity, succesfully linked
the motions of our solar system's bodies to gravitation. {{< meta primary-authors >}}
also prove that the gravitational force due to a spherical _shell_^[Qualitatively, the word _shell_ feels unimportant to me. The proof presented by {{< meta primary-authors >}} is specific to a 
spherical shell, but I suspect that proof can be extended to _all spheres_; after 
integrating over cross-sectional _rings_ on each shell, integrate the force due to each 
infinitesimally thin _shell_. I should try to work this out!] is equivalent to the 
gravitational force due to the shell's _point of center of mass_ @bob.

<!--# TODO work out the solid sphere proof! -->

$$
F = G \frac{M m}{r^2}
$$ {#eq-newton-gravity}

## Work and Energy

The expression for gravitational potential energy $U$ is shown in @eq-potential-gravity,
and gravitational kinetic energy $K$ is shown in @eq-kinetic-gravity.

$$
U = -G \frac{M m}{r}
$$ {#eq-potential-gravity}

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
$$ {#eq-kinetic-gravity}

## Gravitational Constraints

The center of mass of a gravitationally bound system is **constant**. This produces a useful
simplification in the two-body case: the dynamics can be simplified to a reduced mass $\mu$
with position $\mathbb{r}$ orbiting the center of mass of the original system with total mass $M$. 
The equations below are pulled directly from equations 2.22, 2.23, and 2.24 in the text @bob. 

$$
\mu \equiv \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}
$$ {#eq-binary-reduced-mass}

$$
\begin{aligned}
r_1 &= -\frac{\mu}{m_1} \mathbf{r} \\
r_2 &= -\frac{\mu}{m_2} \mathbf{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

In this reduced case of the binary system, the total angular momentum $L$ can be found 
using @eq-binary-angular-momentum.

$$
\mathbf{L} = \mu \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}
$$ {#eq-binary-angular-momentum}

The derivations of Kepler's Laws in Chapter 2 culminate in more general forms of the 
laws' previous mathematical expressions. The following equations, pulled from the text,
are valid for binary orbits @bob. @eq-binary-velocity and @eq-binary-period represents 
the velocity and orbital period of the reduced mass $\mu$, respectively.

$$
\frac{d A}{d t} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{L}{\mu}
$$ {#eq-binary-kepler1}


$$
E = -G \frac{M \mu}{2 a} = -G \frac{m_1 m_2}{2 a}
$$ {#eq-binary-total-energy}

$$
v^2 = G \left(m_1 + m_2\right) \left(\frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a}\right)
$$ {#eq-binary-velocity}

$$
P^2 = \frac{r \pi^2}{G \left(m_1 + m_2\right)}
$$ {#eq-binary-period}
